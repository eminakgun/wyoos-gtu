# Project Report: Process Management System

## 1. Introduction

The Process Management System is a C++ project designed to implement process management functionalities in an operating system environment. The system includes components such as a Task Manager, Syscall Handler, and Process Control Block (PCB) struct to manage processes efficiently.

## 2. Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:
- To create a robust and efficient system for managing processes.
- To implement process creation, scheduling, waiting, and termination functionalities.
- To ensure proper handling of system calls and process dependencies.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- The system should support creating new processes (fork), executing programs (execve), waiting for processes to finish (waitpid), and terminating processes (exit).
- The system should handle system calls from processes and perform the necessary actions based on the syscall type.
- The system should maintain a list of tasks (processes) and manage their states and dependencies.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should be efficient and scalable, capable of handling a large number of processes.
- The system should be robust and handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
- The system should have a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.

## 4. Design

### 4.1 Component Overview
- **Task Manager**: Manages tasks (processes) within the system, including adding tasks, scheduling tasks, waiting for tasks, and terminating tasks.
- **Syscall Handler**: Handles system calls initiated by processes, interprets syscall requests, and interacts with the Task Manager to perform process-related operations.
- **Process Control Block (PCB)**: Stores essential information about a process, including PID, PPID, process state, waitpid, and wait state.

### 4.2 System Architecture
- The system follows a modular architecture, with separate components for managing tasks and handling syscalls.
- The Task Manager interacts with the Syscall Handler to perform process-related operations based on syscall requests.

## 5. Implementation

The project is implemented in C++ and organized into header files (`*.h`) and source files (`*.cpp`). The project directory structure includes:

- `include/`: Contains header files for classes and structs used in the project.
- `src/`: Contains source files for implementing the classes and structs.
- `main.cpp`: Main entry point of the program for testing the functionalities of the classes and structs.

## 6. Challenges

- Implementing proper synchronization and handling dependencies between processes.
- Ensuring efficient memory management for process data and control structures.
- Handling edge cases and errors in process management operations.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Implementing more advanced scheduling algorithms for task management.
- Adding support for inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
- Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 8. Conclusion

The Process Management System project provides a foundation for managing processes in an operating system environment. It implements core functionalities for process creation, scheduling, waiting, and termination, with scope for further enhancements and improvements.
